The library is being developed primarily for my own education.  As I read new papers I integrate functionality into the code.  The library is fully functional though and so far can train an MNIST classifier (with & without convolution) using dropout and cudarray or numpy as a backend.  Also trained on CIFAR.  I tend to track my general progress on http://hedeer.elshowk.com/ML as I implement and test new features.
