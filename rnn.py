#        - recurrent neural network: 
#            - implement toy binary addition network as suggested by hinton.  Input is fully connected to hidden layer.  Hidden layer is fully connected to output and to input layer (?).
#            - hidden layer is composed of three fully connected nodes.
#            - draw it out to get a better idea of what's going on
#            - output layer shows the results of addition two steps back
